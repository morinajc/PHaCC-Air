# Plotting data by census tracts


The objective of this script is to: 
1) Count the number of days each census tract of VA exceeded a 15 Âµg/m3 24-hour mean (WHO guideline) for 2.5 micron particulate matter (PM2.5)
2) Graphically represent the exceedence days on a map of Virginia using the leaflet package

Maps for PM2.5 data can be viewed here (https://rpubs.com/morinajc/VAaq)
